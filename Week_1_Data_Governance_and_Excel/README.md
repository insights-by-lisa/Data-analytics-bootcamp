## 1. Data Governance \& Legal Compliance

During Week 1, I reviewed key UK laws and regulations related to handling data:



\- **Data Protection \& GDPR** – Learned principles of accuracy, minimisation, and storage limitation.  

\- **Freedom of Information Act** – Explored transparency requirements for public authorities.  

\- **Computer Misuse Act** – Studied measures to protect computer systems from unauthorised access.  



These lessons highlighted the importance of secure, compliant, and ethical data management.

## 2. Excel Data Exploration \& Analysis

I practiced managing and analysing datasets using Microsoft Excel:



\- Converted data ranges into **tables** for better organisation.  

\- Used **sorting, filtering, SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN** functions to analyse data.  

\- Applied **conditional formatting** and **data validation** to standardise inputs and link to formulas.  

\- Built **pivot tables and charts** to summarise data effectively.  

\- Used the **SWITCH function** to create dynamic logic for categorising data.  



These tasks strengthened my technical proficiency in Excel and prepared me for data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Data Presentation \& Stakeholder Communication

I learned to communicate insights effectively to different audiences:



\- Tailored presentations to meet the audience’s priorities and expectations.  

\- Practised **public speaking** and structured messaging for clarity and impact.  

\- Evaluated tools such as **Excel, PowerPoint, and Power BI** to select the most effective delivery format.  



This helped me understand how to translate data analysis into actionable recommendations.
