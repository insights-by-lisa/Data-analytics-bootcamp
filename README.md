# Data Analytics Bootcamp Portfolio



Welcome to my Data Analytics Bootcamp portfolio! This repository is organised by week, showcasing the projects, labs, and exercises I completed throughout the course. Each folder contains my work, including code, data analysis, visualisations, and reflections.



## About Me



I enjoy transforming raw data into insightful, visually engaging stories that are easy to understand and interpret. I have a logical mindset, which helps me follow analytical processes clearly and systematically. I also like exploring beyond the curriculum, looking up new code and techniques not covered in class to see what additional insights can be achieved.



## My Learning Highlights



Throughout this bootcamp, I have developed skills in:



\- **Data Analysis \& Manipulation**: Confidently using Excel, Python, and Pandas to clean, sort, filter, and aggregate datasets.  

\- **Data Visualisation**: Creating meaningful visualisations in Tableau and Power BI to communicate insights effectively, including dashboards, heatmaps, bar charts, and interactive reports.  

\- **SQL \& Database Design**: Understanding relational and non-relational databases, performing complex queries, and ensuring data integrity and quality.  

\- **Cloud Computing \& Azure**: Gaining practical experience with cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models, and Azure analytics labs.  

\- **Data Law \& Ethics**: Applying GDPR, DPA 2018, and other relevant legislation to practical scenarios, demonstrating awareness of compliance and privacy considerations.



## Tutor Feedback Highlights



Some key strengths noted by my tutor throughout the course include:



\- Strong analytical thinking and logical problem-solving skills  

\- Clear, professional communication style and structured presentations  

\- Excellent attention to data quality, integrity, and validation  

\- Ability to make insightful connections between datasets and real-world scenarios  

\- Enthusiasm and curiosity in experimenting with advanced features and techniques
