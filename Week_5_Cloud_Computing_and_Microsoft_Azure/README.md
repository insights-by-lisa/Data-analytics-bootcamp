## 1. Cloud Computing Foundations



This week, I explored the transition from traditional on-premises hardware to scalable, on-demand cloud resources.



**Service Models:**

\- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Renting virtual data centres.  

&nbsp; \*Example:\* Netflix uses AWS for streaming.

\- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides platforms for rapid application development.  

&nbsp; \*Example:\* Uber uses Google App Engine.

\- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-to-use web applications.  

&nbsp; \*Example:\* Salesforce.



**Deployment Models:**

\- **Public Cloud:** Shared infrastructure hosted by third-party providers.  

\- **Private Cloud:** Exclusive to a single organization for greater security.  

\- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds—ideal for organizations needing both scalability and security.  

\- **Community Cloud:** Shared between organizations with similar requirements.



**Cloud Provider Comparison:**
| Provider | Strengths | Example Services |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| AWS      | Market leader, highly flexible and scalable | EC2, S3, Lambda |
| Azure    | Integrated with Microsoft products | Virtual Machines, SQL Database, Power BI |
| GCP      | Strong in AI, ML, and data analytics | Compute Engine, BigQuery, Cloud Storage |

## 2. Legal and Ethical Frameworks



Explored the UK legal landscape for data and IT:



\- **Computer Misuse Act 1990 \& Police and Justice Act 2006:** Covers unauthorised access, intent to commit further offenses, and unauthorized modification. The 2006 update addresses modern threats like DoS attacks and malware distribution.  

\- **Intellectual Property \& Privacy:** Copyright infringement, plagiarism, and risks of using pirated software.  

\- **Data Protection in Employment:** Differentiates employer-permissible data (e.g., NI numbers) from sensitive personal data (e.g., biometrics, health) requiring explicit consent.

## 3. Microsoft Azure Technical Proficiency



Hands-on labs and exam preparation strengthened Azure skills:



\- **Azure Labs:** Explored relational and non-relational databases, data analytics, and mapping visualisations.  

\- **DP-900 Practice Exam:** Validated knowledge of cloud data fundamentals and Azure services.

## 4. Strategic Case Study: \*Paws \& Whiskers\*



A retail pet shop moving from spreadsheets to a centralised Azure data platform.



**Project Highlights:**

\- **Architecture Design:** Data Lake Storage for structured and unstructured data (sales, customer photos, social media trends).  

\- **Automation \& Integration:** Azure Data Factory for ETL; Azure Functions for event-driven processes like inventory alerts.  

\- **Data Modelling:** Star Schema to relate customer, product, and transaction data; enables real-time insights via Power BI dashboards.  

\- **Security \& Recovery:** Disaster Recovery with Azure Backup and Site Recovery; ensures GDPR and PCI DSS compliance.
